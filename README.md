## OSM at Lyft

## Who we are

We are a team of trained OSM editors located in Seattle, WA; Minsk, Belarus and Poland. Here is a list of all the members of [Lyft OSM Team](https://github.com/OSM-DCT-Lyft/US/wiki/OSM-Team-Members)

## What are we working on

Lyft OSM team does not participate in bulk editing or importing data created by AI algorithms. Instead we have been focusing on improving the OSM map manually in the areas that can improve the rideshare experience currently and in the future.

## Quality Control

Currently our process is internal double blind quality control. We use the tools listed in the wiki as well as manual analysis of the OSM tags and geometries to ensure quality of our work. 

## OSM Training Decks
