#### We have 3 kinds of data that owned by Lyft:
- **“Lyft telemetry data"** – Lyft drivers GPS tracks 
- **“Lyft-owned street-level imagery”** - photos collected by cameras installed in our drivers' vehicles. This data is updated frequently. Photos are not older than a year, and sometimes even a month. 
- **"Lyft-owned aerial imagery"** – As for now it is ***Nearmap*** imagery. They do allow us to use their imagery for OSM edits by license.
##### Note: We used another terminology to describe our evidence up to November 4, 2022. Therefore, in the comments up to this date, Lyft-owned data are marked as proprietary sources.
